# Bankist App

The Bankist App is a simplistic banking application designed for educational purposes. Inspired by a tutorial in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course, this project aims to simulate basic banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, loan requests, and account transfers. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements, manage data, and implement user interactions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Log in with a user's initials and PIN.
- **Account Operations**: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
- **Loan Requests**: Request a loan that automatically gets approved if certain conditions are met.
- **Balance Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays the current balance, deposits, withdrawals, and interest.
- **Date and Time**: Shows the current date and time on login.
- **Sorting**: Sort transactions by amount.
- **Logout**: A simple logout mechanism that refreshes the application.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bankist-app.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

3. Log in using any of the predefined accounts in the script. For example, use the username `om` (derived from Ã–zcan Mirzanli) and PIN `1111` to log in to the first account.

## How It Works

The application initializes with predefined user accounts. Each user can log in using their initials as the username and a PIN. Once logged in, the user can view their transactions, transfer money to other users, request loans, and sort transactions. The application also calculates and displays the total balance, total deposits, total withdrawals, and interest (calculated as a percentage of the deposits).
